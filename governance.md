# FlamIncome Governance Token

> **All the governance mechanism can be changed by the governance mechanism itself**

The symbol of FlamIncome Governance Token is `FLAG` and its total supply in the first year is `1048576`.

Since the second year, `FLAG` inflation rate will be `100%` per year, which means, total suply is `2097152` in the second year, total supply is `4194304` in the third year ...

`50%` of the infalted tokens (including the inital supply in the first year) will be distributed to the liquidity provider between `nXXX` tokens (i.e. `nUSDT`) and original `XXX` (i.e. `USDT`) tokens.

The other `50%` of the infalted tokens (including the inital supply in the first year) will be distributed to users who participate in the governance (voters).

The high inflation rate is for continuously incentive the new contributors, in another word, if one hold `1` `FLAG`, the only way to keep its token weight (anti-inflation) is to provide liquidity continuously or vote in the DAO.
